protostuff-1.1.0 2014-10-06
---------------------------

+ NOTE: The 1.1.x versions will be not be wire-compatible with the ff:
  - protostuff-runtime-1.0.x
  - protostuff-xml-1.0.x
+ Issue 161: Optimize ProtobufOutput for small nested messages (max size of 127)
+ Issue 157: ConcurrentLinkedDeque support
+ Issue 156: Support for newing object instances on Android 4.3+ devices
  - thanks to eedzjee
+ Issue 153: YamlOutput bug on repeated message fields
+ Issue 151: optimize xml format
+ Issue 141: protostuff ser/der can not keep order of elements in an array which contain null value
  - thanks to lzh0379
+ Issue 119: Reflection-based array operations are rather expensive

protostuff-1.0.8 2013-12-10
---------------------------

+ Issue 140: Multiple runtime schema contexts (IdStrategy groups)
+ new protostuff-runtime-view module
  - select fields to include on ser/deser, without re-creating the expensive runtime fields.
+ Issue 139: Add functionality to load protobuf schema from Reader
+ Issue 138: CodedIpnut.skipRawBytes() incorrectly updates totalBytesRetired when going outside of its buffer.
  - thanks to Max Lanin
+ Issue 135: PluginProtoCompiler throws IllegalStateException when one of the rules (message_block, enum_block) is missing
+ Issue 133: When the varint of large strings (2kb or more) are serialized, unnecessary bytes are written
  A 2kb string previously needed 3 bytes for its varint.
  Now anything under 16kb will only need 2 bytes.
  This is a bug that was overlooked but doesn't have major side effects because of the way varint encoding works.
+ Issue 131: option can't be used as a field name in maven-plugin

protostuff-1.0.6 2012-05-14
---------------------------

+ allow @Tag annotations to override the field name
  - E.g @Tag(value=1, alias="foo")
  - useful for non-binary formats like json/xml/yaml
+ added Delegate, which handles ser/deser for:
  - singletons
  - pojos with no fields
  - pojos that should not be merged
  - could be used to encode a type to a byte array and write it (for example packing an int[] to a byte[])
+ added @Morph field annotation, which overrides:
  -Dprotostuff.runtime.morph_non_final_pojos
  -Dprotostuff.runtime.morph_collection_interfaces (new)
  -Dprotostuff.runtime.morph_map_interfaces (new)

  To optimize polymorphic ser/deser, use abstract classes or atleast declare the base abstract class.
+ add support for annotations on protostuff-runtime to have explicit control of field numbers (patch by Brice Jaglin).
  Annotate all non-transient/non-static fields with @Tag(x) or none at all (all or nothing).
+ Issue 77: RuntimeSchema.getSchema on Android and Server (the solution is to use @Tag annotations)
+ Issue 86: Is RuntimeSchema.createFrom safe (the solution is to use @Tag annotations)
+ Issue 106: Use Double.doubleToRawLongBits (was Double.doubleToLongBits) on serialization (protostuff-core)
  * Not applicable to protostuff-me since the method Double.doubleToRawLongBits does not exist on j2me api
+ new protostuff-runtime-registry module (compact ids for your polymorphic pojos)
+ Issue 105: ObjectSchema needs to check clazz.getSuperclass().isEnum() to detect complex enums
+ Issue 88: Add support for transparent handling of non-standard collections

protostuff-1.0.4 2011-10-24
---------------------------

+ Issue 90: byte arrays on protostuff-runtime were not treated as scalar fields
            Best to update to this version for performance reasons.
            If you have existing data that came from a pojo with byte[] fields, it will not be compatible on deser.
            You can safely update the data by deserializing with the old protostuff from a different classloader 
            and writing it back again using the new protostuff on another classloader.

+ Issue 87: EnumSet and EnumMap without generics are not handled

---------------------------

+ new protostuff-me module (for j2me by Michael Donohue)
+ new protostuff-runtime-md module (for modern mobile devices like android and kindle)
  api+core works fine but this is for those who prefer runtime schemas.
+ Issue 73: Remove unused enum default value from java_bean generated code
+ Issue 70: Use FQCN everywhere in classes generated by java_v2protoc_schema
+ Issue 69: Maven plugin to attach generated source directory to the project compile source roots
