protostuff-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
+ Issue 23: Validation missing (for required fields) when nested messages are "group_encoded"

protostuff-1.0.0.M2 2010-06-22
+ more IO optimizations
+ Issue 22: Enable parsing of service/rpc in proto for code generation
+ Issue 21: Support java-style compilation mode where imported messages do not need to be referenced by full name
+ Issue 20: Compiler throws NPE if no package defined in proto file 
+ added protostuff-api (protostuff-core, protostuff-json and protostuff-xml will only contain their respective IO impl).
+ added a runtime option for nested messages to be "group-encoded" for more efficient serialization. (especially for rpc).
+ added an abstract helper class CustomSchema to easily customize how messages can be read/written and for adding filters/hooks as well.
+ added messageName() and messageFullName() methods to the schema to support full xml serialization of existing C++ protoc messages.
  This also enables aliasing of the message names (especially for xml) by overriding the messageName() method.
+ added protostuff-xml for fast xml ser/deser via stax api.
